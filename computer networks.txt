Analog and digital signal
analog signal--> It is a signal in which the signal magnitude varies in a smooth fashion without  any break with respect 
to time as shown
digital signal--> it is a signal in which the signal magnitude has a constant level for some period of time,then it changes
 suddenly to another constant level

trnsmission impairments--> in comunication system the recived signal is never identical to transmitter one due to some 
transmission impairment
reason-->attenuation and attenuation distortion
	|-->the strength of a signal decreae with increase in distance travelled over a medium	
	delay distrotion-->problem persent in wired media
	noise-->when data travelled over a transmission medium noice is added to it

performance-The performance of data communication network can be measured with the help of following parameter
1] bandwidth	2]Jitter	3]Delay	4]Throughput
bandwidth-->it is used for measuring the network performance
throughput-->it is used to know the speed  of data transmission over a network.
	defined as the actual rate at which the info is sent over the channel.measured in but/second or frame/sec
Jitter-->defined as the variation in delay for the packets belonging to the same flow
delay--> is due to the time required for buffering,queueing switching and routing
		

############################### Analog and Digital Transmission ############################

digital transmission
info is sent from one point to other .we cannot sent info as it is.instead it has to be converted into either a digital signal
or an analog signal for transmission
use of digital signal for transmission has many advantages	

*Analog to analog conversion*
analog data such as voice,video etc into analog signal aka modulation
		________
analog data  ------>	|Modulator| ----->	modulated analog signal
		---------------


*Digital to Analog Conversion*
digital data at input is converted into analog signal and are transmited over transmisison medium done by modems	
eg--> transmitting digital data through the public telephone network

*Analog to Digital conversion*
conversion of analog data to digital signal aka digitisation
it is essenial in all digital communication system like pulse code modulation or delta modulation
to carry out this transformation it should follow a sequence of operation such as sampling,quantization and enconding

*diigtal to digital conversion*
the digital data which is normally binary in nature is converted into a sequence of discrete discontinous voltage pulses

*line coding*
it is defined as process of converting binary data ,a sequence of bits to a digital signal
data such as text,number ,images and audio video are stored in computer memory in form of sequence
line coding converts these sequence into digital signal

unipolar-- it use only one voltage level other than zero	.so engoder signal will have +A volts value or 0
polat - it uses two voltage levels other than zero such as +A/2 and -A/2
