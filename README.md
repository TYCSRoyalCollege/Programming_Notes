# Dart_Notes
The objective of this repository is to keep notes on Dart programming language. As you learn many other languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and PHP, it is important that you have some notes that have been practiced by you, in order to be able to recall your skills when you come back to your previous language again in the future.
